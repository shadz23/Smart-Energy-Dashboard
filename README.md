Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear view of when and how electricity is used in a household. The dashboard highlights peak hours, daily and weekly patterns, device-level estimates (where possible), and cost breakdowns.
- Audience: energy analysts, homeowners, facility managers, and students working with time-series electricity data.
- Tech: Power BI Desktop for report authoring, Power Query (M) for ETL, DAX for measures and time intelligence.

Key features
- Hourly and daily load visualizations (line charts, area charts).
- Heatmap that shows load by hour and day of week.
- Load profile clustering (basic segmentation inside Power BI).
- Estimated cost calculator based on tariff slabs or flat rates.
- Peak detection and rolling averages for smoothing spikes.
- Exportable PBIX with full data model, visuals, and measures.
- Reusable Power Query logic for different datasets.

Dataset
- Source used in examples: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€” "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set".
- Typical fields:
  - Date, Time
  - Global_active_power (kW)
  - Global_reactive_power (kW)
  - Voltage (V)
  - Sub_metering_1 (kWh)
  - Sub_metering_2 (kWh)
  - Sub_metering_3 (kWh)
- Frequency: 1-minute samples (original). The project uses aggregated views (minute â†’ hourly, daily) to optimize visuals.
- Data quality steps: parse date/time, handle missing values, remove outliers beyond physical limits, aggregate to useful time grain.

Power Query (ETL) â€” recommended steps
1. Source
   - Import CSV or text file. For the UCI dataset use proper delimiter and header row.
2. Parse datetime
   - Merge Date and Time into a DateTime column.
3. Convert types
   - Set numeric columns to Decimal Number, DateTime to Date/Time.
4. Handle errors
   - Replace text-based missing values ("?") with null, then decide on interpolation or removal.
5. Aggregate
   - Use Table.Group to compute Hourly and Daily aggregates:
     - Hourly: Average or sum Global_active_power per hour.
     - Daily: Sum kWh per day.
6. Create time attributes
   - Add HourOfDay, DayOfWeek, WeekOfYear, Month, IsWeekend.
7. Load to model
   - Load raw minute-level only if needed. Prefer hourly aggregates for performance.

Example M snippet (Power Query)
```m
let
  Source = Csv.Document(File.Contents("household_power_consumption.txt"),[Delimiter=";", Columns=9, Encoding=65001, QuoteStyle=QuoteStyle.None]),
  Promoted = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
  Replaced = Table.ReplaceValue(Promoted,"? ",null,Replacer.ReplaceText,{"Global_active_power","Global_reactive_power","Voltage","Sub_metering_1","Sub_metering_2","Sub_metering_3"}),
  ChangedTypes = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Replaced,{
    {"Date", type date}, {"Time", type text}, {"Global_active_power", type number}, {"Voltage", type number},
    {"Sub_metering_1", type number}, {"Sub_metering_2", type number}, {"Sub_metering_3", type number}
  }),
  AddDateTime = Table.AddColumn(ChangedTypes, "DateTime", each DateTime.From(Text.Combine({Date.ToText([Date],"yyyy-MM-dd"), [Time]}," "))),
  RemovedCols = Table.RemoveColumns(AddDateTime,{"Date","Time"}),
  Hourly = Table.Group(RemovedCols, {"DateTimeHour"}, {
    {"kW_avg", each List.Average([Global_active_power]), type nullable number},
    {"kWh_sum", each List.Sum([Global_active_power]) / 60, type nullable number} } )
in
  Hourly
```
Replace "household_power_consumption.txt" with your file name.

DAX measures â€” examples
- Total kWh (daily)
```dax
Total_kWh = SUM('Hourly'[kWh_sum])
```
- Rolling 7-day average (daily table)
```dax
Rolling7_kWh = 
CALCULATE(
  AVERAGE('Daily'[kWh]),
  DATESINPERIOD('Calendar'[Date], LASTDATE('Calendar'[Date]), -7, DAY)
)
```
- Peak hour (hourly table)
```dax
PeakHourValue = MAXX(VALUES('Hourly'[HourOfDay]), CALCULATE(MAX('Hourly'[kW_avg])))
```
- Estimated cost using simple tariff rate in model (Rate per kWh as parameter)
```dax
EstimatedCost = SUMX('Daily', 'Daily'[kWh] * SELECTEDVALUE(Parameters[RatePerkWh], 0.15))
```
- Time-of-use cost example with tiers (simplified)
```dax
Cost_TOU = 
SUMX(
  'Hourly',
  'Hourly'[kWh_sum] *
  SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'Hourly'[HourOfDay] >= 18 && 'Hourly'[HourOfDay] < 22, Parameters[PeakRate],
    Parameters[OffPeakRate]
  )
)
```

Installation â€” download and run
- Visit Releases and download the PBIX file:  
  https://github.com/shadz23/Smart-Energy-Dashboard/releases  
  The file in the Releases section is the packaged Power BI report. Download the .pbix file and open it with Power BI Desktop (version 2.XX or newer as indicated in the release notes). After opening, update the data source in Power Query if you use a local dataset, then click Refresh to load data.
- If you prefer the source queries only, download the M files from Releases and paste them into Power Query Advanced Editor.
- If the above link is not reachable, check the repository Releases section in GitHub.

Usage tips
- Use the Calendar table for time intelligence. Create a single-date calendar and mark it as a Date Table in the model.
- Keep grain consistent. If you visualize hourly data, use hourly aggregations in the model to avoid heavy queries.
- Use aggregations and measures rather than calculated columns for performance.
- For large datasets, import hourly summaries instead of minute-level rows.
- Parameterize tariffs via a Parameters table so users can test different rate scenarios.

Performance notes
- Prefer import mode for datasets up to several million rows. Use DirectQuery only when data changes often and the source can handle complex queries.
- Reduce visuals per page. Each visual applies queries; keep pages focused.
- Disable unnecessary auto date/time in Power BI options and use a dedicated Calendar table.
