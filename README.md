## Project Overview

This project leverages the Household Electric Power Consumption dataset to create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI. It helps users visualize their electricity consumption trends, understand peak usage hours, and estimate electricity costs, enabling better energy management and conservation.

---

## Features

- Visualize household electricity usage over time  
- Identify peak hours and usage patterns  
- Estimate electricity costs based on consumption  
- Interactive filtering and data slicing using Power BI tools  

---

## Dataset

The data used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption).

You can download the dataset from the link above or find it in the `data/` folder (if added to the repo).

## Installation and Setup

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavmule-code/Smart-Energy-Dashboard.git

## Usage

- Use the filters on the dashboard to select date ranges, appliances, or other parameters.
- Explore visualizations for detailed insights on energy consumption and costs.
- Export reports or snapshots using Power BIâ€™s export features.
